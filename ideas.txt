1) College students need a way to properly schedule their work and commuting alongside their sleep cycle so they're able to 
perform optimally as much as possible. Otherwise, too much or too little sleep will make it harder for them to 
perform their best in college. It should be done such that the student still has free time 
left over and he/she rotates between tasks so as to return to each one with a fresh mind each time, 
making them easier to finish and making the student more productive. 

2) Travelers need a more convenient way of planning out international trips on every level: both global and local. Not only should all possible airplane routes be 
suggested, but after selecting one's desired places, as well as one's food preferences, and what kind of things he/she likes, an a list of several possible iternaries also 
throughout local areas should be formed that the user can tweak to their preference.
